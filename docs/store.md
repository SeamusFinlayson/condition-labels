_Quickly apply auras to tokens_

This extension provides a simple menu that allows you to configure an aura, then apply it by clicking on a token.

## The Tool

To get started, click the _Auras_ tool on the right side of the window.

When you click on the tool, it will open the **configuration menu**. The menu allows you to configure an aura's radius, opacity, and color. It remains open when you click away. To close it, click "close tool" or click on another tool.

Click on a token to **apply** the aura from the configuration menu. The aura will be attached and centered on the token and locked but will not scale with the token.

To **delete** an aura, double-click it and click delete.

If you need **more configurations**, you can double-click an aura you created and customize it as you would any other circle you might draw. This tool is meant to skip repetitive setup, not provide in-depth customization.
